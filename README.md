## ABSTRACT
Industrial design focuses on minimizing fabrication variability, aiming for identical products, while craft practice often results in unpredictable outcomes. We rely on crackle, an explicit pottery phenomenon that renders a pattern of cracks in ceramic glazing, to produce craft-unique outcomes in a moderately controlled design process. With the help of a dedicated CAD tool and a laser machine, we embed artificial decorations in a crackle pattern. By pre- processing the clay and post-processing the glaze, we demonstrate a technique to partially control the typical size of cracks in a given area, thus embedding visual forms in the glaze.

My work is described in the sections 'Crackle Pre- and Post-Processing Methods' and 'Computer-Aided Pattern-Detection'.
Mostly focusing on the post-process tool. We used Grasshopper, a parametric plug-in for Rhino, to visualize forms, sizes, and hierarchies of cracks in ceramic tiles (see Fig. 4C). The tool can assist the user by visually marking distinct groups of symmetry (such as marking square crackles in blue and triangular in red) and
grid orientation, allowing the user to decide what symbol or pattern will work with the given crackle pattern. 
The code can be seen under the folders here: rhino3dm, gasshopper and matlab.
